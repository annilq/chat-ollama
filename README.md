### tips
Ollama's API doesn't actually support Server-Sent Events (SSE) natively.Instead, it uses a line-delimited JSON streaming format, So I can't use ```react-native-sse``` to get stream Data ,and the React Nativeâ€™s fetch API struggles with handling stream responses so far , so I can only display the feedback when the response completed.
